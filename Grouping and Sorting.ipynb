However, often we want to group our data, and then do something specific to the group the data is in. To do this, we can use the `groupby` operation.\n\nFor example, one function we've been using heavily thus far is the `value_counts` function. We can replicate what `value_counts` does using `groupby` by doing the following:"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"reviews.groupby('points').points.count()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"`groupby` created a group of reviews which allotted the same point values to the given wines.
